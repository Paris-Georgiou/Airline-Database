# Airline-Database

This project revolves around the understanding of the Select function, the Procedures and the Views that the SQL language offers.

The database that we were given had the following form:
flights(#fno, fromCity, toCity, distance, depDate, depTime, arrDate, arrTime, price)
aircrafts(#aid, name, crange)
employees(#empid, lastname, firstname, salary)
certified(#empid,#aid)
